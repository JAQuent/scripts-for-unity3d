// Attach this script to the game object that you want to move. There are two modes, 
// which are controlled by the boolean variable actionNeedToBeEnded. If true, then each 
// action has be started & ended with a button press. This is expecially for situation in
// an MRI scanner where button press are not transmitted continuously. If false, then that 
// is not necessary the movement happens as long as button is pressed, which is also allows
// rotation & translation at the same time. 
// The static variables allow you to change speed (e.g. ThreeButtonMovement.forwardSpeed = 20.0f),
// to access whether there the character is currently moving forward. This was added so that we can
// track which time segements include forward movement at which direction for grid-like activity studies
// Further more, you can reset every movement and change the keys assignment
// (e.g. ThreeButtonMovement.leftTurn = (KeyCode) System.Enum.Parse(typeof(KeyCode), newKeys[0]);).

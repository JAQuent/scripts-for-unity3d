# scripts-for-unity3d
This repository contains various C# scripts written for VR experiments in unity3d.

# List:
* **_trackObjects.cs_** is designed to track a number of game objects (position and rotation) in unity3d saving the data in .txt file. The script - for instance - can be used to track the player or the VR camera and the controllers. Instruction how to use it are in the script.

* **_csharpFunctions.cs_** is a collection of short functions that can be used for unity3d. Especially it includes functions that reads in a .txt file and then parses that information to a list of float/int. This is useful to give unity input tables. This is not a stand-alone script.

* **_moveCamera.cs_** is a script that moves and rotates a camera or effectively any other gameObject through a series of way points and stops a specified amount of time after arriving at each point.
